                 <p>“Harlequin and Friar Bacon” is a British pantomime play from the collection of Glenn
                     Hughes who used the collection in the 1930s and 1940s as a tool for research and
                     teaching his students in the drama program at the University of Washington. It comes
                     from a collection of over 3,000 plays, the majority British. It is likely that
                     “Harlequin and Friar Bacon” belongs to the subset within the collection of works
                     added from a single contributing collection, all of which were made as sales or
                     gifts to the audience of a performance, mainly consisting of Christmas
                     extravaganzas, pantomimes, and burlesques. Pantomimes are usually performed around
                     Christmas and are comedies that often include slapstick humor, jokes, innuendos,
                     magic, fairies, and gender reversal.</p>
                 <p>The focus of our edition of “Harlequin and Friar Bacon” is digitizing the original
                     play to become accessible to actors and students who are interested in its content,
                     whether that be for purposes of studying drama or gleaning an understanding of the
                     content of historical plays. Pantomimes are still performed in the United States but
                     with less frequency and popularity than in England, so the edition will also
                     function to introduce actors to studies of plays on a global scale.</p>
                 <p>Our edition features a transcription which is intended to maintain as much of the
                     original content as possible, including preserving the British spellings for words
                     as opposed to Americanizing them. Racial slurs have been redacted and given note in
                     the end notes if relevant to understanding the passage. Any italics and bold are
                     preserved as they are displayed in the original play. In the original print,
                     advertisements line the jacket and are interspersed throughout the text, which have
                     not been preserved in this digital edition because it is not intended for viewing by
                     audiences but by actors.</p>
