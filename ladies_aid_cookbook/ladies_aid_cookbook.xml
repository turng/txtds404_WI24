            <p>The Ladies' Aid Society cook book is an instructional text divided into the following
               sections: Soups, Fish, Meats, Vegetables, Bread, Relishes, Salads, Pies, Cakes,
               Puddings, tables of weights and measure, Candies, and an unnamed section containing
               recipes for household fluids. Each section contains different recipes. First, we
               transcribed ten different pages of recipes from various sections. After some of these
               recipes, there is a name of a person who contributed the recipe to the cookbook. The
               page numbers are at the bottom of each page. Also, since everything is organized
               similarly, we planned to reflect this in our transcription. Finally, we have written
               a diplomatic transcription since our text is so sparse and modern. <bibl>

         <!-- GT: put the 2 intro paragraphs into a single <div type="intro">. That brings it together -->
         <p>A great way to engage in and learn much about a historical period can come from cuisine
            and the foods people used to prepare and eat. The Ladies’ Aid Society cook book was
            published by the Vincent Methodist Episcopal Church in Spokane, WA, in 1915. It is an
            interesting text because this is not only a cookbook but also a kind of guidebook for
            homemakers of the time. It is an instructional text divided into sections one might find
            in a typical cookbook, such as Soups, Fish, Meats, Vegetables, Bread, Relishes, Salads,
            Pies, Cakes, Puddings, tables of weights and measure, and Candies. An unnamed section
            also contains recipes for household fluids like library paste. At the end of some of
            these recipes, there is a name of a person who contributed the recipe to the cookbook.
            The original copy also contains full-page advertisements on every other page, akin to
            what is seen in Victorian serials, with advertisements promoting products and businesses
            of the local community.</p>
         <p>We created a digital version of this text because we believe anyone interested in
            cuisine, food, and the history of the early 20th century would be curious about this
            text and to bring about a new appreciation for this unique text from the Special
            Collections of the University of Washington Library. If anyone wants to know how food
            played a role in the history and culture of the time, they would be interested in this
            book. Because the original text is so modern and sparse, special care was put into
            transcribing the text presented here as diplomatically as possible. This edition was
            created to provide historical recipes for readers for various purposes, be it a study of
            ingredients available, the culinary culture of the early 20th century, or kitchen
            technology. Even though the text has full-page advertisements on every other page, these
            have been omitted from our edition, as we felt that they were extraneous information and
            rather that the effort should be put into including as many recipes as possible.</p>
