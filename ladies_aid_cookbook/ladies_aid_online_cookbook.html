                    <p>A great way to engage in and learn much about a historical period can come
                        from cuisine and the foods people used to prepare and eat. The Ladies’ Aid
                        Society cook book was published by the Vincent Methodist Episcopal Church in
                        Spokane, WA, in 1915. It is an interesting text because this is not only a
                        cookbook but also a kind of guidebook for homemakers of the time. It is an
                        instructional text divided into sections one might find in a typical
                        cookbook, such as Soups, Fish, Meats, Vegetables, Bread, Relishes, Salads,
                        Pies, Cakes, Puddings, tables of weights and measure, and Candies. An
                        unnamed section also contains recipes for household fluids like library
                        paste. At the end of some of these recipes, there is a name of a person who
                        contributed the recipe to the cookbook. The original copy also contains
                        full-page advertisements on every other page, akin to what is seen in
                        Victorian serials, with advertisements promoting products and businesses of
                        the local community.</p>
                    <p>We created a digital version of this text because we believe anyone
                        interested in cuisine, food, and the history of the early 20th century would
                        be curious about this text and to bring about a new appreciation for this
                        unique text from the Special Collections of the University of Washington
                        Library. If anyone wants to know how food played a role in the history and
                        culture of the time, they would be interested in this book. Because the
                        original text is so modern and sparse, special care was put into
                        transcribing the text presented here as diplomatically as possible. This
                        edition was created to provide historical recipes for readers for various
                        purposes, be it a study of ingredients available, the culinary culture of
                        the early 20th century, or kitchen technology. Even though the text has
                        full-page advertisements on every other page, these have been omitted from
                        our edition, as we felt that they were extraneous information and rather
                        that the effort should be put into including as many recipes as
                        possible.</p>

                                This segmentation is to be expected, as the setting of the early
