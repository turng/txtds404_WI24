            <title>The Shakespeare Club of Port Gamble, Washington</title>
         </titleStmt>
         <publicationStmt>
            <p>This edition covers the daybook's entries from December 14 1896 to January 11 1987.
               Residents of Port Gamble, Washington may be interested in reading this edition,
               particularly the descendants of the Gove family. Upon doing research, our group
               realized that the Gove family may have been an important family in the town that
               worked in tugboat service, which was essential in Kitsap County. There is even a
               historical house/landmark in town called the Gove House. We imagine that the
               residents of Port Gamble and descendants of the Gove family would be interested in
               this edition as it gives a glimpse into what life and leisure was like in the late
               1800s. </p>

         <div type="editorial_intro">
            <p>Port Gamble, Washington is a windswept town along the Puget sound, and in 1896 its
               quaint Victorian homes were chiefly occupied by the bourgeois families drawn to
               Kitsap county for its burgeoning industries. Herein, the records of the Port Gamble
               Shakespeare club illuminate the lives of some of its prominent female residents;
               beyond the paper trails left by their husband’s occupations. Consider the Gove
               family, whose home is now a historic landmark. Its patriarch, William Gove, was a
               tugboat captain employed by the Puget Mill Company and had moved to Port Gamble with
               his wife Laura from Maine. Their four daughters were participants in the Shakespeare
               club, cropping up frequently in cast lists and in correspondence with the club
               president.</p>
            <p>This digital edition of the Port Gamble Shakespeare Society aims to tell the story of
               the women of the Gove family whose stories have been overlooked in the discussions of
               historical families in Port Gamble. We hope to highlight the lived experiences and
               shared relationships of these women. By the 1900 census, all but one member of the
               Gove family had left Port Gamble. But for an eventful few months in 1896 and 1897,
               there were marriages, lead roles and deaths all indirectly chronicled through the
               lens of the Shakespeare club. This edition may be especially interesting for
               residents of Port Gamble and the descendants of the Gove Family as it intentionally
               celebrates the lives and relationships of the women of Port Gamble’s Shakespeare
               Club.</p>
            <p>These meeting minutes, recorded in club secretary Mrs. Ame’s exceptional handwriting,
               were transcribed to the best of the publisher’s ability. Spelling will be retained as
               written, with an understanding that each transcription of cursive represents a kind
               of best-guess. Errors, given the spontaneous nature of the text, will be retained. In
               instances of post-script correction, the original and corrected text will be noted.

            </opener>
            <p><name ref="#Carrie">Carrie</name> told me to-day that mention was made at the Club last evening about my non-attendance, so I decided to address an explanation to you as President.</p>
            <p>When the Club first formed for this winter, I told the members that I could not possible attend while Carrie and <name ref="#Emily">Emily</name> were both away from home as I had no time for study and did not want to go with my lesson unprepared. I also said I thought that I could begin again at the first of the year.</p> 
            <p>But I did not know then that Carrie would be married soon. You can see that now she is gone &amp; I am in the same predicament I was before.</p> 
            <p>I did not think about resigning, for I hoped to be able to attend before very long, and also wished to help the Club in anything they might understake for Xmas, etc.</p> 
            <p>Now that we have decided to move to <name type="place" ref="#Townsend">Port Townsend </name>in three or four months, I think it may be well for me to hand in my resignation. So will you kindly inform the Club of my desire that they may take the necessary action.</p>
            <p>I have enjoyed the work and sociability very much and hope the society will ever be as earnest and enjoyable as when I was in it.</p>
            <p> If there is ever anything I can do to help you, please let me know as I will always be interested.</p>
            <p>Hoping my explanation is acceptable, and wishing you all sucess, I remain</p>
