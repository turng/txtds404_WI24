            <p>This transcription of "Poems" was created as our final project submission for Professor Turnovsky's TXTDS 404 course, "Texts, Publics and Publication" at the University of Washington. Poems was chosen amongst various texts provided by the UW Libraries' Special Collections department. Our intention with this transcription was to preserve the content of Eddy's poetry, and provide through our poem selections and annotations a curated understanding of Eddy's beliefs and life. The literary content of the poems and historical period of time they were written in were a central focus in our transcription efforts. </p>

            <p>Mary Baker Eddy’s Poems is a collection of poetry written by Eddy during the course of her life, dated from childhood through her last years. As editors, we found this text notable because we wanted to contextualize Eddy’s poems by researching additional historical and biographical information, therefore deriving and providing more meaning from her work. An aspect of note is that there are varying levels of context provided for each poem. Only a portion of Eddy’s poems have footnotes listing the year and location the work was written. With the help of additional biographical information, we are able to piece together additional context. But many of the poems do not have that level of specificity. Some only list the year or time period in which it was written; many do not provide footnotes at all. This gives us a significant challenge when it comes to contextualizing Eddy’s poems.</p>
            <p>The goal of our project is twofold. The first is to attempt to contextualize some of Eddy’s poems based on clues, seeing if we could utilize stylistic and thematic elements to provide our best guess as to when and where the poem was written. In addition, for the poems with identifying information, we are going to provide annotations with facts about Eddy’s life during the time it was written. Our second goal is to share which poems stood out to us. Our edition only contains ten poems, and we picked our favorites to feature. This could give insight as to which of Eddy’s poems continue to be impactive in the twenty-first century.</p>

               <l>And sketching in light the heaven of my youth—</l>

               <l>Of a mother's love, that no words could speak</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I'm thinking alone of a fair young bride,</l>
               <l>The light of a home of love and pride;</l>
               <l>How the glance of her husband's watchful eye</l>
               <l>Turned to his star of idolatry.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I'm picturing alone a glad young face,</l>
               <l>Upturned to his mother's in playful grace;</l>
               <l>And the unsealed fountains of grief and joy</l>
               <l>That gushed at the birth of that beautiful boy.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I'm weeping alone that the vision is fled,</l>
               <l>The leaves all faded, the fruitage shed,</l>
               <l>And wishing this earth more gifts from above,</l>
               <l>Our reason made right and hearts all love.</l>

               In 1866, Mary experienced an injurous fall in Lynn Massachusetts, having slipped on a patch of ice. The treatment of this injury involved morphine doses, which Mary continued taking through the end of her life. The fall marked a moment of spiritual revelation for Eddy, who attributed her recovery to teachings from the Bible and subsequently delved further into spititualism and the foundation of Christian Science.

               Christian Science is the religion founded by Mary Baker Eddy. Its followers believe in healing and transformation through spirituality,  specifically through the doctrines and teachings of the Bible. After experiencing her own accident and divine healing, Mary spread her doctrines through her foundational textbook Christian Science and the Church itself. Founded in 1879, Christian Science is still a religion today.

               Science and Health is the foundation scripture of Christian Science, written by Mary Baker Eddy from 1872-1975. The text is 500 pages long, was published by Christian Science Publishing Co., and is available through the organization's website. Christian Scientists refer to Science and Health alongside the Bible within their sermons, the teachings of both being integral to their religion.

            <note>There are two types of line breaks seen in Mary's poetry. An End-Stop is when a line of poetry ends on a period or natural break in the sentence. An Enjambment is when a sentence continues across multiple poetic lines.

         <!-- Is this the correct place to host bibliographic information, or in body of the text? -->
         <!-- GT: it validates! Normally you'd put notes and bibliography in the <back> of your <text>, in which case they're considered part of the text.
            Like endnotes and bibliographies in a printed book you'd buy. <standOff> is a (newer) more database oriented approach, where the notes/bibliographies exist separately: outside and alongside the text. For <listPerson>, <listPlace> and <listEvent>, this is more common. But TEI and digital encoding is a chance to rethink the print models, so if you prefer this organization, that's fine with me. I think it's a terrific experiment with these editorial models. -->
