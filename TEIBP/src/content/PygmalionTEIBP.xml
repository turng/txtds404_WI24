            <stage rend="italics">Covent Garden at 11.15 p.m. Torrents of heavy summer rain. Cab whistles blowing
               frantically in all directions. Pedestrians running for shelter into the market and
               under the portico of St. Paul's Church, where there are already several people, among
               them a lady and her daughter in evening dress. They are all peering out gloomily at
               the rain, except one man with his back turned to the rest, who seems wholly
               preoccupied with a notebook in which he is writing busily.</stage>

               <p>I'm getting chilled to the bone. What can Freddy be doing all this time? He's been
                  gone twenty minutes.</p>

            <stage>[Freddy rushes in out of the rain from the Southampton Street side, and comes
