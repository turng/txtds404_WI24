            <p>The present documents reflect a small sample of the corpus known as the Jasper N.
               Bertram papers. These papers contain an eclectic mix of letters, newspaper clippings,
               business documents, greeting cards, pamphlets, personal correspondences, and notes.
               The documents are printed, typewritten, and handwritten; some contain a mix of text
               types. The archive within the University of Washington Special Collections provides a
               brief <ref type="note" target="#JN_Bertram">biographical overview</ref> of Jasper N.
               Bertram's life.</p>

               record so that it may aid in distribution and availability of these materials
               digitally. The duration of Jasper N. Bertram's life encompasses a critical time in
               our nation's history, from the Civil War, through the Industrial Revolution and the
               First World War, to his death during the Roaring Twenties. The chosen documents
               provide readers with a unique historical perspective of an individual with interests
               rooted in Seattle and beyond.</p>

                  <p>The former practice of the Government in deducting and <lb/>paying the attorney

                     of the 20th century. Before the first vaccine was created in the 1890s, 1 out

                        feet<lb/> and a depth of 150 feet. There will be an arcade<cb/> driveway
                        around the entire building, with room<lb/> for wagons to load in the read,
                        under cover. The<lb/> building will be equipped with two freight eleva<pc

                        this business alone, on one<lb/> floor of a small building immediately
                        opposite the site of our new building<lb/> on Arch Street. He began with the
                        publication of one book, which<lb/> fortunately proved very successful. This
                        book was sold by agents whom<lb/>

                     <p> At first <persName ref="#J_Winston">Mr. Winston</persName> had his books

                        many years ago this was found<lb/> inconvenient. Our present establishment

                     <p>While we do a very extensive business with agents on subscription<lb/>
                        books, and have always made a specialty of this line of books, we are<lb/>
                        to-day doing business all over the world, and are publishing books and<lb/>
                        Bibles in <lang>English</lang>, <lang>French</lang>, <lang>German</lang>,
                           <lang>Swedish</lang>, <lang>Norwegian</lang> and other<lb/>
                        languages.<lb/></p>
                     <p>Any local banker or large merchant, having access to the usual<lb/>
                        mercantile records, can satisfy any inquirer as to our general standing
                        and<lb/> reliability. It is always easier to do business with those with
                        whom you<lb/> are acquainted, and we desire to establish a feeling of
                        confidence with all<lb/> those in correspondence with us, so that they may
                        feel entire confidence<lb/> in any arrangement we may seek to make. If we
                        have had marked and<lb/> unusual success in building up so large a business
                        in a few years, from a<lb/> small beginning, we must attribute it chiefly to
                        our facilities for helping<lb/> agents to succeed, because it has been the
                        success of canvassers that has<lb/> brought about our own success and rapid
                        growth.<lb/></p>
