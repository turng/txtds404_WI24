            <p>The present documents reflect a small sample of the corpus known as the Jasper N.
               Bertram papers. These papers contain an eclectic mix of letters, newspaper clippings,
               business documents, greeting cards, pamphlets, personal correspondences, and notes.
               The documents are printed, typewritten, and handwritten; some contain a mix of text
               types. The archive within the University of Washington Special Collections provides a
               brief <ref type="note" target="#n1">biographical overview</ref> of Jasper N.
               Bertram's life.</p>

               digitally. The duration of Jasper N. Bertram's life encompasses a critical time in
               our nation's history, from the Civil War, through the Industrial Revolution and the
               First World War, to his death during the Roaring Twenties. The chosen documents
               provide readers with a unique historical perspective of an individual with interests
               rooted in Seattle and beyond.</p>
