            <p>Our text is meant to be published as a digital edition for a webpage that an audience
               can visit to learn more about the language of flowers, their meanings, and how it
               would have been used in the Victorian era. It was originally created to fulfill
               course requirements in a textual and digital studies class at University of
               Washington and was published on a personal website.</p>
         </publicationStmt>
         <sourceDesc>
            <p>The source edition is an early printing of Kate Greenaway's illustrated Language of
               Flowers. Our source is in University of Washington Libraries' Special Collections and
               is classified as Historical Children's Literature. <bibl>

            <p>Our project is meant to de-mystify modern understanding of the flower communication
               that British and American peoples in the Victorian era would use with friends,
               lovers, and family. We hope that this edition provides an education not just on the
               meaning of flowers, but also how they would have been properly used regardless of
               what 21st-century Hollywood and Harlequinn claim. By cross-referencing the flowers
               and their meanings to the poetry at the end of the edition, we hope to broaden our
               audience's understanding of what it meant to use flowers as a form of
               communication.</p>
         </projectDesc>
         <samplingDecl>
            <p>We edited pages from each of the three main sections of our source text. These
               sections include two lists, one which is centered on flowers and the other which is
               centered on their meanings, and the third section is one of poetry that relates to
               flowers or meanings mentioned in the previous lists. This sampling allows us to
               present an overall understanding of the source itself while still fulfilling the
               purposes of our specific edition. By choosing some pages that are highlighted in the
               source text via major illustrations and definitions and poetry that align with those
               pages, we hope that our audience gains a broader appreciation for the language of
               flowers.</p>
         </samplingDecl>
         <editorialDecl>
            <normalization>
               <p>We only updated the spelling of "u" to "o" where necessary and adjusted any "ash" symbols to "ae." These are referenced in the notes. Otherwise, we maintained the spelling of the original, but for the difficult poems, we included a reference in the bibliography to a modernized edition for anyone who wanted to research these further. We hope this keeps the romantic flair of the text while also providing our readers easier understanding of a Victorian work.</p>
            </normalization>
            <segmentation>
               <p>We have segmented the text into three sections: two lists and one section of
                  poetry. While the source text does not explicitly separate these sections, we will
                  have headers that show when a new section begins and ends.</p>
            </segmentation>
            <p>Cross references will be provided for the flowers that are emphasized in the text
               with illustrations and these cross-references will connect to poems that reference
               these flowers and the list of meanings that has no illustrations. We will also add
               notes referencing how these flowers would have been used by the average Victorian
               person, as well as other information that might be useful or interesting to our
               audience.</p>

         <div type="editorial_intro">
            <p>The small illustrated book, <ref target="#context">Language of Flowers</ref> (1884) is meant to be read as an
               illustrated dictionary of meanings for common northern hemisphere flowers,
               reflecting the popularity of floriography in the Victorian era. To enhance the
               reader’s understanding of the meaning of the flowers, the illustrator Kate Greenaway
               (attributed as author) drew specific images that reflect on specific flowers and
               their meanings and included poems that relate or mention certain flowers that are
               listed in the main portion of the text. While the text was originally published as a
               children’s educational book, it would also have been useful for new debutantes as
               they entered society. The illustrations and poetry add a romantic flair, which would
               have added to the appeal for this group when they began courting.</p>
            <p>For our edition, we seek to introduce fans of novels from the Victorian and Georgian
               eras to something that might educate them about the use of flowers, particularly in
               the Victorian era. The information we provide via annotations is what we believe the
               original audience would have innately understood. To do this, we provide annotations
               on how the flowers might have been used, information about the poets cited in the
               back of the book, and we also provide some background on scholars’ research
               pertaining to Victorian etiquette and floriography. To connect everything together,
               we specifically chose to annotate flowers with meanings explicitly illustrated in the
               original text. We hope our target audience can still enjoy shows such as Bridgerton
               while bringing a more realistic understanding of real life in the Victorian era to
               their viewing.</p>
            <p>One major change we do make is adding in titles to the three different sections of
               the text. We do this for ease of reading and understanding, but we also hope to keep the romantic flair of the original by not updating the language of the poems at the end of the book. We do make minor spelling changes as noted in the text, but we do not feel this sacrifices any part of the original or our intent to educate our audience on floriography.</p>

                  <figDesc>A woman in a short-sleeved, green dress reclines in a chaise lounge while
                     holding a letter in her right hand. She is wearing a bonnet and gloves, and to
                     the right of the chaise is a side table with two drawers. On top of the table
                     is a white vase filled with pink flowers, and behind the woman is a window with
                     yellow curtains. The curtains are pulled back, and outside the window is a
                     glimpse of green lawn.</figDesc>

                  Christmas card came out, and she even inspired Robert Louis
                  Stevenson! While she is most well-known for her illustrations of
                  children's books, she was also prolific in designing Christmas cards and
                  watercolor portraits. The Language of Flowers is perhaps the most well-known of
                  all her works, but to study more of her work, see <ref target="#examples">"Kate

               <note><ref target="daiches">Burns</ref> was a Scottish poet and tenant farmer. He
                  struggled through much of his life, but when he published his book of poems,
                  he was almost instantly heralded as a great writer. Many of his poems were
                  written to popular folk tunes that he was familiar with, which is why "O
                  Luve Will Venture In" is attached to the tune of "The Posie."

                  Nicholas Drayton, we believe that this references <ref target="#mdrayton">Michael Drayton</ref>, an early
                  17th century poet and playwright. This poem is found in Drayton's larger
                  work "The Muses Elysium," which confirms our understanding of this artist.
                  He lived and worked in England, spending most of his time in London, but he

            <note xml:id="daffodil" n="1">In our source text, daffodils are associated with regard and with <ref target="#wordsworth">Wordsworth's</ref> poem of the same title. It is also known as the narcissus <ref target="#wilkinson">(Wilkinson 197)</ref>, and they can be white, yellow, or orange. They grow from bulbs and have been worked on extensively in Holland as well as England <ref target="#wilkinson">(157).</ref> They grow best in sandy loam or heavy soil (201), and they fail in very hot climates <ref target="#wilkinson">(209).</ref> Because they are bulb flowers, they must be <ref target="#wilkinson">"well rooted" (206)</ref> before they can be grown in a greenhouse or before blooms can be expected.Once they have bloomed, the tall flowers make for striking boutquets, and they may have been used in courting to alert a woman to possible interest without being a full declaration of love.</note>
            <note xml:id="daisy" n="2">Not all daisies have the same meaning. The michaelmas daisy, for example, means "farewell" and also "afterthought" according to <ref target="#greenaway">Kate Greenaway, but the garden daisy means "I partake of your sentiments," and the wild daisy means "I will think of it." For daisies that don't fall under these categories, Greenaway claims that the standard daisy represents "innocence" <ref target="#language">(Language).</ref> While <ref target="#burns">Burns</ref> does not use this exact phrase, he does think that the daisy represents "simplicity" and an "unaffected air." So many varieties of daisies exist because people have been selectively breeding them for centuries, and now many of them can be found in the wild <ref target="#wilkinson">(Wilkinson 21)</ref>. Most daisies are perennial, which means they will bloom live for three years or more, but a couple of kinds, including the michelmas daisy, are merely annual plants. They tend to bloom in early spring, and they cannot be planted too close together if they are to thrive <ref target="#wilkinson">(22)</ref>. </ref></note>
            <note xml:id="nightshade" n="3">Is it any surprise that a book written to children and young women includes the flower associated with witchcraft and sorcery? Enchanter's nightshade is called such because the latin name, circaea lutetiana, references Circe, the Greek goddess known for herbology and magic <ref target="#woodland">(Woodland)</ref>. The flower was often used medicinally, especially in its native Scotland and Britain. Some have also used it as an aprhodisiac, although this is no longer recommended <ref target="#woodland">(Woodland).</ref></note>
            <note xml:id="larkspur" n="4">Pink and purple larkspur each have their own associated meanings (fickleness and haughtiness, repsectively), and all other larkspur is associated with lightness and levity <ref target="#language">(Greenaway)</ref>. This flower is not referenced in any of the poems included in this edition, but their tall stems and long stalks of flowers add interest to any bouquet. Larkspur is the annual flower in the delphinium family <ref target="#wilkinson">(Wilkinson 67)</ref>, and although they are beautiful, they are poisonous to both people and animals <ref target="#petruzzello">("Larkspur")</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="lily" n="5">The yellow lily represents falsehood and gaiety <ref target="#language">(Greenaway)</ref>, but <ref target="#burns">Burns</ref> remarks that the lily is "pure" and "fair" in <ref target="#posie">"The Posie."</ref> Since he does not give us a color, we can't be sure if <ref target="#burns">Burns</ref> is referencing a yellow lily, and that is why Greenaway included this poem, or a white lily, which more commonly represents death or sorrow yet is not included in either this edition or our source text.</note>
            <note xml:id="bride" n="6">Mourning bride flowers are associated with "unfortunate attachment" or with losing "it all" <ref target="#langauge">(Greenaway)</ref>. They are pincushion flowers, which means they have dense bursts of petals at their heads, and they come in many different colors. The mourning bride in particular is usually a dark red and black <ref target="#wilkinson">(Wilkinson 294)</ref>. These are annual flowers that need a lot of sun <ref target="#wilkinson">(297)</ref>, so they would not always grow well in England, but they do very well in southern Europe <ref target="#wilkinson">(297)</ref>. With care, however, they can be grown almost anywhere.</note>
            <note xml:id="mulberry" n="7">White mulberry trees represent wisdom, and black mulberry trees represent the feeling that without another person, one will not survive <ref target="#language">(Greenaway)</ref>. They are native to the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and North America, and they are valued for the sweet fruit they produce <ref target="#mpetruzzello">("Mulberry").</ref> They can also be used as homes for silkworms <ref target="#mpetruzzello">("Mulberry").</ref></note>
            <note xml:id="periwinkle" n="8">Periwinkle, like <ref target="#larkspur">larkspur</ref> and <ref target="#daisy">daisies</ref>, has different associated meanings depending on the color of the plant. Blue periwinkle represents early friendship, and white periwinkle represents the pleasures of memory <ref target="#langauge">(Greenaway)</ref>. Periwinkle grows as a trailing plant <ref target="#wilkinson">(Wilkinson 357)</ref>, so it can create beautiful overhanging notes in any bouquet. These are native to Great Britain and do best in cool, moist climates <ref target="#wilkinson">(357)</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="posie" n="9">A posy is another word for a nosegay or a small bouquet. This was the most popular form of floral communication in Victorian England <ref target="#nosegay">("Nosegay")</ref>. Women would often carry posies as part of their accoutrement, and, of course, nosegays were extremely popular forms of communication from an admirer to his would-be beau. In his poem, <ref target="#burns">Robert Burns</ref> is telling his readers the work he endures to show his "dear Mae" how much he loves her <ref target="#language">("The Posie")</ref> through floral communication. Women could respond in kind, with flowers that showed their love, such as the <ref target="#daisy">daisy</ref>, or that showed their indifference, such as the mustard seed <ref target="#nosegay">("Nosegay")</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="rose" n="10">The rose, of course, is the symbol of romantic love. Bridal roses represent happy love, and yellow roses represent jealousy. White rosebuds represent girlhood, and sending someone campions means that only they deserve the sender's love. Damask roses are a sign of freshness, and a garland of roses was a tribute to the receiver's virtue. There are over three hundred species of roses, and most of them are somehow related to love in significance and meaning. The rose that most U.S. and European readers think of when they think of a "rose" is the long-stemmed hybrid tea rose <ref target="#wilkinson">(Wilkinson 276)</ref>. These are the close petals and small thorns found on the bouquets of red roses sold in most stores around Valentine's Day. North America and Great Britian do have some native species, but the classic roses that most people assocaite with love were imported from China or other Asian countries and then hybridized and cultivated into the many species we have today (273). The damask and attar roses are especially useful in creating perfumes and other scents. Growing and caring for roses is not that difficult, but the gardener must take care to keep them sheltered from the wind and provide well-drained, rich soil for their nutrients <ref target="#wilkinson">(278)</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="william" n="11">Sweet williams are associated with gallantry, so it makes sense that they would be included in a bouquet meant to encourage a woman to accept a man's admiration, respect, and love. These perennial flowers can be any shade of red, purple, or white and are often used as borders to a bouquet <ref target="#wilkinson">(Wilkinson 70)</ref>. They do not bloom until their second year of growth, but the beauty and edibility of the flowers made it a popular garden flower in the Victorian age <ref target="#wilkinson">(70).</ref></note>
            <note xml:id="thrift" n="12">Thrift is associated with sympathy. These might have been sent when someone died or when a young lover was jilted. The colors of the flowers can vary in any shade of white, yellow, blue, lilac, or red, and the perennial nature guarantees blooming for at least three years <ref target="#wilkinson">(Wilkinson 312)</ref>. Even though they are associated with sympathy, their pom-pom style blossoms add cheerfulness to any nosegay.</note>

            <note xml:id="context"><p>Floriography was a popular study in the Victorian age, in part due to the Victorians’ obsession with reference manuals, classification, and dictionaries <ref target="#engelhardt">(Engelhardt 137)</ref>. In this period, however, floriography moved from a pastime for just women to a wider project of social service and science by a growing field of amateur botanists. This study became assumed common knowledge, as Engelhardt notes that “Victorian writers expected a certain degree of floral literacy from their readers and used floral codes strategically in their fiction as subtexts for practitioners of the language of flowers” <ref target="#engelhardt">(136)</ref>. These readers and writers would pull on information put out by amateur botanists in this fledgling scientific field through their reference manuals codifying flowers and their meanings so that both writers and readers  could “extend the parameters of courtship and imaginative play” <ref target="#engelhardt">(156)</ref>.</p> 
               <p>This knowledge, along with the proliferation of other Victorian manuals on etiquette and other subjects, reflects a growing middle class and the emergence of new forms of marketing towards that middle class. These etiquette guides, while serving other social purposes, also show new desires and demands for commodities and material goods in the Victorian age <ref target="#weller">(Weller)</ref>.</p> 
               <p>From this information, we can conclude that this booklet was one kind of informational booklet that would have been purchased for children, debutantes, and anyone else who was interested in the study of floriography, even if they were not part of the upper echelons of London society during this time. </p>
