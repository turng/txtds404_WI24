            <p>This text in particular is interesting because of the connectivity it fosters between
               the past and the present, specifically in regards to the subject of “fancy and
               ornamental” work. In that sense, our edition hopes to offer a text that highlights
               various methods of ornamental work that were utilized in the past, thus allowing us
               to preserve these traditional practices, introduce a new audience of people to them,
               and invite comparison between the methods of the past and those of the present day.
               Within our class at the University of Washington, we first chose a specific section
               of the text to focus on, ultimately ending up choosing the knitting section because
               its relatively concise nature meant we would be able to complete an entire section.
               We then transcribed the text into plain text digital files and created a project
               schema to guide our TEI markup. We plan to encode and markup our text and create some
               sort of digital edition interface to help facilitate our goals and bring our text to
               a modern audience.</p>

            <p>Published in 1859 by John E. Potter &amp; Company, The Ladies’ Handbook of Fancy and
               Ornamental Work is an instructional text written by Miss Florence Hartley, who
               ensures her readers that the material within her pages was “compiled from the best
               authorities.” This historical handbook is centered around traditionally-feminine
               crafts and skills, such as sewing, baking, crocheting, embroidery, and – as this
               editorial edition specifically focuses on – knitting. Given that these types of texts
               are not as commonplace in today’s society or literary sphere, Hartley’s text provides
               an interesting look at the culture and practices of the past.</p>
            <p>Specifically focusing our efforts on Hartley’s instructions for knitting, this
               specific edition offers an overview of numerous knitting-based crafts exactly as they
               were done in the late nineteenth century. We hope to bring visibility to these
               traditional practices by presenting them to a new audience of people, ultimately
               helping to preserve the knowledge and culture of past generations. For those that
               have no prior experience with knitting, this text may serve as a captivating
               introduction to the practice itself, especially in the context of its history. On the
               other hand, for readers that do have experience with knitting, this edition may
               provide a basis for intriguing comparisons between the methods of the past and those
               of the present day.</p>
            <p>For this edition, there were very minor changes made from the source text,
               specifically in terms of transcription. While a majority of Hartley’s text is indeed
               presentable to a modern audience, there were a small number of spelling and grammar
               alterations made to best ensure that the instructions of this edition were as clear
               as possible.</p>

            <note xml:id="n1"><ref type="biblio" target="#HowToCastOn">A current, common way for
               beginners to cast on uses the thumb method. Knitters start by creating a loop out
               of a single thread and pulling the loose end of the yarn through the loop to
               create a slip knot. Then, the slip knot is placed onto the needle and the loose
               yarn is brought around the thumb to create a loop that the needle slides through.
               Holding the needle with the left hand, the right hand holds the yarn attached to
               the yarn ball, wraps it around the needle and pulls down, slides the loop on the
               left thumb over and onto the needle, and the yarn tail is pulled down to create
               the first stitch.</ref></note>
            <note xml:id="n2"><ref type="biblio" target="#NeedleSizes">Yarn weight must also be
               taken into account when choosing a needle. The finer/thinner the yarn being used,
               the smaller the needle should be. In the common range today, a very thin 2-ply
               yarn should be paired with a US size 0-2 needle, a medium-thick 8-ply yarn should
               be paired with a US size 3-6, and the thickest 14-ply yarn should be paired with a
               US size 11-17 needle.</ref></note>

            <note xml:id="n4"><ref type="biblio" target="#WashingTechnique">Often, hand knitted
               works require a special washing practice. Contemporary washing practices require
               you to look at the yarn label for any specific instructions pertaining to washing.
               Usually, you use a mild detergent mixed with warm water in a basin or sink,
               submerge the yarn in the soapy water and agitate it to loosen any dirt or residue,
               rinsing thoroughly to remove any soapy residue, gently squeezing the item to
               remove excess water, and laying it on a clean towel or drying rack to air dry. You
               can block the yarn to shape it and even out any inconsistencies in texture or
               gauge during the drying step.</ref></note>
