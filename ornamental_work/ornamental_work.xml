            <p>This text in particular is interesting because of the connectivity it fosters between
               the past and the present, specifically in regards to the subject of “fancy and
               ornamental” work. In that sense, our edition hopes to offer a text that highlights
               various methods of ornamental work that were utilized in the past, thus allowing us
               to preserve these traditional practices, introduce a new audience of people to them,
               and invite comparison between the methods of the past and those of the present day.
               Within our class at the University of Washington, we first chose a specific section
               of the text to focus on, ultimately ending up choosing the knitting section because
               its relatively concise nature meant we would be able to complete an entire section.
               We then transcribed the text into plain text digital files and created a project
               schema to guide our TEI markup. We plan to encode and markup our text and create some
               sort of digital edition interface to help facilitate our goals and bring our text to
               a modern audience.</p>

            <p>Published in 1859 by John E. Potter &amp; Company, The Ladies’ Handbook of Fancy and
               Ornamental Work is an instructional text written by Miss Florence Hartley, who
               ensures her readers that the material within her pages was “compiled from the best
               authorities.” This historical handbook is centered around traditionally-feminine
               crafts and skills, such as sewing, baking, crocheting, embroidery, and – as this
               editorial edition specifically focuses on – knitting. Given that these types of texts
               are not as commonplace in today’s society or literary sphere, Hartley’s text provides
               an interesting look at the culture and practices of the past.</p>
            <p>Specifically focusing our efforts on Hartley’s instructions for knitting, this
               specific edition offers an overview of numerous knitting-based crafts exactly as they
               were done in the late nineteenth century. We hope to bring visibility to these
               traditional practices by presenting them to a new audience of people, ultimately
               helping to preserve the knowledge and culture of past generations. For those that
               have no prior experience with knitting, this text may serve as a captivating
               introduction to the practice itself, especially in the context of its history. On the
               other hand, for readers that do have experience with knitting, this edition may
               provide a basis for intriguing comparisons between the methods of the past and those
               of the present day.</p>
            <p>For this edition, there were very minor changes made from the source text,
               specifically in terms of transcription. While a majority of Hartley’s text is indeed
               presentable to a modern audience, there were a small number of spelling and grammar
               alterations made to best ensure that the instructions of this edition were as clear
               as possible.</p>

            <ab type="InstructionProse">It is a good plan to have children taught to knit, boys as
               well as girls, and to have them learn to knit without looking at their work. Old
               ladies who have lost their sight often knit very beautifully, and as a general rule
               we find that they began very young, and learned to knit without giving their work
               steady attention. The blind in all Asylums are beautiful knitters, and in case of any
               accident to the eyesight it would be a great resource, as well as when deprived of

                  work you have to do. In all large trimming stores where this kind of material is
                  kept, they will tell you the best sizes, if you are ignorant yourself.</ref></ab>

            <ab type="InstructionProse">These caps look the prettiest when of two colors. The
               material is single Berlin wool. Scarlet and white contrast extremely well. To
               commence, <ref target="#CastOn">cast on</ref> seventy-two loops on the smallest sized
               ivory needles, with the scarlet wool; knit and purl until you have five <ref
                  target="#Row">rows</ref> knitted on the right side; this forms one stripe. Take
               the white wool and repeat this, only reversing the stripe, continue this process
               until you have nine stripes, purled and knitted alternately; five of the scarlet,
               four of the white. Before <ref target="#CastOff">casting off</ref> prepare as
               follows: take the first loop upon your needle, drop the second, take the third, and
               so on to the end of the row, taking care to avoid any mistake, which would be the
               ruin of the whole. The first and last loops must of course be preserved. You will now
               have just half the original number of loops upon your needle. <ref target="#CastOff"
                  >Cast off</ref>, leaving the wool very loose. Afterwards assit the dropped loops
               to run down. This makes a very simple but very pretty stitch in knitting.</ab>

               or trouble. These laces, when knit with fine thread and small needles, are
               exceedingly pretty. When they are intended for common wear, or to trim the bottom of
               petticoats, they should be knit with needles of the ordinary size, and coarse cotton.
               They wash well, and wear a long time. After a little practice, a great facility in
               knitting them is acquired, and the work progresses with a rapidity which young
               beginners are apt to despair of obtaining.</ab>

            <note xml:id="n1" source="#HowToCastOn">A current, common way for beginners to cast on
               uses the thumb method. Knitters start by creating a loop out of a single thread and
               pulling the loose end of the yarn through the loop to create a slip knot. Then, the
               slip knot is placed onto the needle and the loose yarn is brought around the thumb to
               create a loop that the needle slides through. Holding the needle with the left hand,
               the right hand holds the yarn attached to the yarn ball, wraps it around the needle
               and pulls down, slides the loop on the left thumb over and onto the needle, and the
               yarn tail is pulled down to create the first stitch.</note>
            <note xml:id="n2" source="#NeedleSizes">Yarn weight must also be taken into account when
               choosing a needle. The finer/thinner the yarn being used, the smaller the needle
               should be. In the common range today, a very thin 2-ply yarn should be paired with a
               US size 0-2 needle, a medium-thick 8-ply yarn should be paired with a US size 3-6,
               and the thickest 14-ply yarn should be paired with a US size 11-17 needle.</note>
            <note xml:id="n3" source="#SkeinDefinition">A common term utilized by those who practice
               knitting, a skein is a loosely coiled length of length of yarn, thread, or other
               material wound onto a reel.</note>
            <note xml:id="n4" source="#WashingTechnique">Often, hand knitted works require a special
               washing practice. Contemporary washing practices require you to look at the yarn
               label for any specific instructions pertaining to washing. Usually, you use a mild
               detergent mixed with warm water in a basin or sink, submerge the yarn in the soapy
               water and agitate it to loosen any dirt or residue, rinsing thoroughly to remove any
               soapy residue, gently squeezing the item to remove excess water, and laying it on a
               clean towel or drying rack to air dry. You can block the yarn to shape it and even
               out any inconsistencies in texture or gauge during the drying step.</note>
            <note xml:id="n5" source="#ShadedWoolDefinition">Shaded wool refers to yarn that has
               been dyed in multiple colors creating a gradient or variegated effect giving your
               work a visually appealing color variation.</note>
