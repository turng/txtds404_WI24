                <p>Published in 1859 by John E. Potter &amp; Company, The Ladies’ Handbook of Fancy
                    and Ornamental Work is an instructional text written by Miss Florence Hartley,
                    who ensures her readers that the material within her pages was “compiled from
                    the best authorities.” This historical handbook is centered around
                    traditionally-feminine crafts and skills, such as sewing, baking, crocheting,
                    embroidery, and – as this editorial edition specifically focuses on – knitting.
                    Given that these types of texts are not as commonplace in today’s society or
                    literary sphere, Hartley’s text provides an interesting look at the culture and
                    practices of the past.</p>
                <p>Specifically focusing our efforts on Hartley’s instructions for knitting, this
                    specific edition offers an overview of numerous knitting-based crafts exactly as
                    they were done in the late nineteenth century. We hope to bring visibility to
                    these traditional practices by presenting them to a new audience of people,
                    ultimately helping to preserve the knowledge and culture of past generations.
                    For those that have no prior experience with knitting, this text may serve as a
                    captivating introduction to the practice itself, especially in the context of
                    its history. On the other hand, for readers that do have experience with
                    knitting, this edition may provide a basis for intriguing comparisons between
                    the methods of the past and those of the present day.</p>
                <p>For this edition, there were very minor changes made from the source text,
                    specifically in terms of transcription. While a majority of Hartley’s text is
                    indeed presentable to a modern audience, there were a small number of spelling
                    and grammar alterations made to best ensure that the instructions of this
                    edition were as clear as possible.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>To attempt to enumerate the many articles which can be made by knitting would be useless as volumes might be written without exhausting the subject and its advantages, both of use and ornament, are alomst as inexhaustible.</p>
                    <p>Knitting can truly be called the friend of the aged and blind; the fingers supplying the want of eyesight and solacing many weary hours which otherwise would be tedious to bear. It gives employment to the poor, amusement to the rich, and supplies to all something in the way of garments, wither useful or ornamental. </p>
                    <p>The beautiful shawls, so fashionable of late years, are many of them knit by ladies in their moments of leisure; caps, comforters, tippets, gaiters, shoes, &amp;c, are made in vast quantities, either for money or for gifts to friends.</p>
                    <p>In ornamental knitting, with silk and beads, the number is almost as great as for purely useful articles. The implements necessary are different sizes of needles, called knitting needles, and cotton, wool, or silk, as desired.</p>
                    <p>The position of the hands is important in learning to knit, either to be a rapid or elegant knitter; but practice alone will enable a person to become athorough proficient. </p>
                    <div>
                        <figure>
                            <img src = "knit.png" alt = "The nine steps of casting on."/>
                            <figcaption>The nine steps of casting on.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                    </div>
                    <p>Fig. 1. <em>The first process in casting on.</em> - Hold the end of the cotton between the first and second fingers of the left hand, twist it over the thumb and forefinger, and bend the latter to twist the cotton into a loop; bend the needle in the loop; hold the cotton, attached to the reel, between the third and little fingers of the right hand, and over the point of the forefinger; bring the thread round the needle, by slightest possible motion; bend the needle towards you, and tighten the loop on the left hand finger, in letting it slip off to form the first stitch. </p>
                    <p>Fig. 2. Now take that needle with the loop on it, in the left hand, and another in the right. Observe the position of the hands. The left hand needle is held between the thumb and the second finger, leaving the forefinger free, to aid in moving the points of the needles. This mode of using the forefinger, instead of employing it merely to hold the needle, is the great secret of being able to knit without looking at the work; for so extremely delicate is the sense of touch in this finger, that it will, after a little practice, enable you to tell the sort of stitch coming next, in the finest material, so that knitting becomes merely mechanical. The engraving indicates the mode in which the right hand needle should be held. Insert the point in the loop, bringing it behind the other needle, slip the thread round it, bring the point in front, and transfer the loop to the left hand needle, without withdrawing it from the right hand. Repeat the process for any number of stitches required.</p>
                    <p>Fig. 3. <em>Plain Knitting.</em> - Slip the point of the right hand needle in a loop, bring the thread round it, and with the forefinger, push the point of the needle off the loop so that the thread, just twisted round forms a new one on the right hand.</p>
                    <p>Fig. 4. <em>Purling.</em>-The right hand needle is slipped in the loop in front of the left hand one and the thread after passing between the two is brought round it. It is then worked as before. The thread is always brought forward before beginning a purled stitch, unless particular directions to the contrary are given.</p>
                    <p>Fig. 5. <em>The mode of making stitches.</em> - To make one, merely bring the thread in front before knitting when, as it passes over the needle, it makes a loop; to make two, three, or more, pass the thread round the needle in addition, once for two, twice for three, and so on.</p>
                    <p>Fig 6. <em>To decrease.</em> - Take one stitch off without knitting; knit one, then slip the point of the left hand needle in the unknitted stitch, and draw it over the other. To decrease two or more, slip one, knit two, three, or more together as one and pass the slip stitch over.</p>
                    <p>Fig 7. <em>The way to join a round.</em> - Four or five needles are used in round work, such as socks, stockings, &amp;c. Cast on any given number of stitches on one needle, then slip another needle in the last stitch before casting any on it; repeat for any number. When al are caset on, knit the first two stitches off on to the end of the last needle. One needle is always left unused in casting on for a round.</p>
                    <p> Fig 8. <em>The way of joining the toe of a sock, or any similar thing.</em> - Divide all the stitches on to two needles, hold both in the left hand as if they were one, and in knitting, take a loop off each one, which knit together.</p>
                    <p>Fig 9. <em>To cast off.</em> - Knit two stitches; with the left hand needle draw the first over the second; knit another; repeat. Observe that the row before the casting-off should never be very tightly knitted.</p>
                    <p>Fig 10. This shows the mode of knitting three stitches together, so that the center one shall be in front. Slip two off the needle together; knit the third, and draw the others over together. To raise a stitch is to knit the bar of thread between the two stitches, as one.</p>

                </header>
                MATERIALS.- One ball of No.16 Orne knitting wool; No. 11 knitting pind;
                one-half ounce shaded amber; one-half ounce of deep claret Berlin wool.
                No.
                2 Penelope Hook; 1 yard of twilled colored lining; two-thirds yard of
                claret-colored
                cotton or silk velvet; as much bran as will stuff the cushion hard. Some
                silk gimp or worsted bullion fringe to match, and four rassles.
                <div>
                    <figure>

                        <figcaption>BOOK CUSHION IN ORNE KNITTING.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>The Orne knitting ball consists of beautifully colored threads of fine wool knotted at equal lengths, each knot terminating one row and this, when knitted up, produces the engraved elegant design which is twenty-two inches long by seventeen broad.</p>
                <p>With the claret Berlin wook cast on 140 stitches, then join on the Orne knitting ball and knit it in moss-stitch, thus:</p>
                <p>1st Row.-Slip 1. Knit and pearl each stitch alternately.</p>
                <p>2nd.-Slip 1. Pearl and knit alternately.</p>
                <p>Observe that the stitch which was pearled must in the next row be knitted and always slip the first stitch. By continuing this from knot to knot the design will work itself out but should the thread of wool be too long or too short, tighten or slacken the preceding stitches with a pin or the finger and thumb but invariably bring the knot to the edge. When the ball is knitted up, eighth the claret wool work a row of Dc all round making three stitches into each corner stitch of the knitting. Then, with shaded wool, work a row of double L stitches all round. <em>These are made by twisting the wool twice over the hook; work three stitches into every stitch at the corner.</em> Then, with claret wool, work another row; damp the knitting, pull it, and lay it between linen clothes under a heavy weight. Now make up the cushion and trim it as in engraving. This work will wash and look equal to new by mixing a little ox-gall with a little curd soap lather, and washing it in the ordinary way, spreading it out to dry and turning it frequently.</p>

                <div>It is a good plan to have children taught to knit, boys as well as girls, and
                    to have them learn to knit without looking at their work. Old ladies who have
                    lost their sight often knit very beautifully, and as a general rule we find that
                    they began very young, and learned to knit without giving their work steady
                    attention. The blind in all Asylums are beautiful knitters, and in case of any
                    accident to the eyesight it would be a great resource, as well as when deprived
                    of sight by old age.</div>

                <div>By means of the following directions, every lady can provide herself with lace
                    edgings of the most durable kinds, and without either much expense or trouble.
                    These laces, when knit with fine thread and small needles, are exceedingly
                    pretty. When they are intended for common wear, or to trim the bottom of
                    petticoats, they should be knit with needles of the ordinary size, and coarse
                    cotton. They wash well, and wear a long time. After a little practice, a great
                    facility in knitting them is acquired, and the work progresses with a rapidity
                    which young beginners are apt to despair of obtaining.</div>

                    for beginners to cast on uses the thumb method. Knitters start by creating a
                    loop out of a single thread and pulling the loose end of the yarn through the
                    loop to create a slip knot. Then, the slip knot is placed onto the needle and
                    the loose yarn is brought around the thumb to create a loop that the needle
                    slides through. Holding the needle with the left hand, the right hand holds the
                    yarn attached to the yarn ball, wraps it around the needle and pulls down,
                    slides the loop on the left thumb over and onto the needle, and the yarn tail is
                    pulled down to create the first stitch.</div>

                    be taken into account when choosing a needle. The finer/thinner the yarn being
                    used, the smaller the needle should be. In the common range today, a very thin
                    2-ply yarn should be paired with a US size 0-2 needle, a medium-thick 8-ply yarn
                    should be paired with a US size 3-6, and the thickest 14-ply yarn should be
                    paired with a US size 11-17 needle.</div>

                <div class="note" id="n4"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Often, hand knitted
                    works require a special washing practice. Contemporary washing practices require
                    you to look at the yarn label for any specific instructions pertaining to
                    washing. Usually, you use a mild detergent mixed with warm water in a basin or
                    sink, submerge the yarn in the soapy water and agitate it to loosen any dirt or
                    residue, rinsing thoroughly to remove any soapy residue, gently squeezing the
                    item to remove excess water, and laying it on a clean towel or drying rack to
                    air dry. You can block the yarn to shape it and even out any inconsistencies in
                    texture or gauge during the drying step.</div>
