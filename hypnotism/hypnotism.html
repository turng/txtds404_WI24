        </div><!--TEI front--><div class="tei_front">
            <p>At the turn of the twentieth century, the concept of hypnotism experienced a surge in
                public interest and experimentation from areas such as scientific inquiry,
                entertainment, and therapeutic applications (LoC). The lead editor of this text, E.
                Virgil Neal, capitalized on this cultural fascination towards hypnosis as another of
                his various entrepreneurial endeavors; he began giving hypnosis demonstrations in
                the mid-1890s (Conroy, 70), and in 1897, he wrote a book titled Hypnotism As It Is,
                which set the stage for Hypnotism and Hypnotic Suggestion (Conroy, 35). Hypnotism
                and Hypnotic Suggestion covers various uses of hypnosis, from the medical to
                religious, but Neal and Clark personally contributed work which emphasized the more
                practical and business related uses of hypnosis (Conroy, 41). The other 28 authors
                of Hypnotism and Hypnotic Suggestion were considered specialists in the field,
                coming from universities such as Harvard and Yale (Conroy, 41).</p>
            <p>Hypnotism and Hypnotic Suggestion was intended to be instructional, aimed towards
                students of Neal, Clark, and their other colleagues in the New York Institute of
                Science, namely Thomas Adkin (Conroy, 70). The New York Institute of Science, which
                was a mail-order company selling fraudulent degrees and courses relating to
                hypnotism and personal magnetism, only operated from 1899 until 1912, because it was
                shut down by the U.S. government (New York Tribune, pages 18 &amp; 11). According to
                the 1913 indictment, the co-editors and Adkin had collaborated in a fraudulent
                hypnotic suggestion mail-order scheme, of which this text was a part (New York
                Tribune, pages 18 &amp; 11). Given this, we hope readers can read this edition for
                entertainment purposes, but not for educational purposes. With its fraudulent
                nature, this edition can be used by students to learn more about a "scam" during
                this time period, or to use the activities in the text for fun.</p>
            <p>When transcribing and editing this text, we chose to keep the text as close to the
                original as possible, except for some visual aspects that don’t affect the reading
                of the text (such as omitting specific line breaks and page breaks). We did not
                update spellings, vocabulary, or other textual parts of the book.</p>

                    <p>Be sure that you thoroughly understand just what to do before attempting to
                        hypnotize anyone.</p>
                    <p>If you stop and hesitate and wonder what to do next, you will never influence
                        anybody. Go about your work in a business-like way and show people by your
                        actions that you thoroughly understand what you are doing.</p>
                    <p>You must not expect to hypnotize everybody you try. Remember all successful
                        operators and noted hypnotists came to be such only by long practical
                        experience.</p>

                    <p>If you do not succeed with the first five or ten that you try, do not give
                        up, but continue trying. Try twenty or thirty different persons, or more if
                        necessary, and just as sure as the sun shines you will find someone whom you
                        can hypnotize. You cannot fail if you persevere and read our instructions
                        carefully. After you hypnotize one or two, it will be easy, and soon you can
                        affect the majority of those whom you try; and with still more practice will
                        be able readily to hypnotize 70 or 90 per cent.</p>
                    <p>Determine to succeed and you will succeed. If you undertake this study in a
                        half-hearted way, if you go about it in a perfunctory sort of manner it were
                        better a thousand times over that you never undertook it. The greater your
                        deficiencies in personal magnetism the more difficult will it be for you to
                        master these sciences, and the more evident your need of further knowledge
                        of this mysterious power. Bear in mind that perseverance is the price of
                        success; knowledge does not come unsought.</p>

                            continuation of the title (though no other sections do this).</span>
                        Then remember that a good hypnotist might possibly try ten people and not
                        hypnotize any of them, because they resist. They may say they do not, though
                        they do. With different people the whole ten might be affected. You should
                        make due allowance for this. Should you not meet with the success you
                        anticipate, it will probably be because you do not follow our directions.
                        Many think they are doing just as the instructions direct, when in reality
                        they are doing nothing of the kind. Read the instructions carefully and
                        slowly a number of times and study them well until you know each step as
                        well as you know your A, B, C's, and if you have any determination or
                        perseverance whatever, you cannot possibly make a failure. You are as
                        certain to succeed as one and one are two. After the ice is broken, that is,
                        after you have hypnotized the first one or two, you will have confidence,
                        and you yourself will be surprised and mystified at your work.</p>

                    <p>You must be sure to give all your suggestions in a very positive tone. A
                        feeble, whining way of speaking never accomplishes anything. Be a person of
                        some force of character. Speak positively and directly to your subject, and
                        influence is certain. Do not give up until you have tried at least fifty
                        persons between the ages of 15 and 30, and be sure while trying each one
                        that you do just as the instructions direct. We ask you to do this because
                        we know positively that after you hypnotize one, the work will be very easy
                        and you can influence a large percentage. There is a certain knack required,
                        and while nearly all persons get this knack very readily from our
                        instructions and can soon hypnotize, still there is occasionally a person
                        who has to try over and over before he acquires just the proper method of
                        procedure. Many, however, who find the work a little difficult at first,
                        make the finest hypnotists.</p>

                <p>In this article I shall give the student my three favorite methods of producing
                    hypnosis, and in doing so I shall endeavor to explain the methods so that the
                    student may learn just how to hypnotize and mesmerize.</p>
                <div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2_div.1">

                                style="font-weight:bold">METHOD NO. 1.</em></span></h2>
                    <p>Have the subject seated in a comfortable chair or lying on a bed or couch.
                        Place the thumb of the subject’s left hand against your left thumb, with the
                        inside of the thumbs together.</p>
                    <p><em style="font-weight:bold">METHOD NO. 1.</em></p>
                    <p>Then grasp, with the fingers of the left hand, the base of the subject’s left
                        thumb, between the thumb and the first finger. The pressure should be firm
                        without hurting the subject. The thumbs should be in a perpendicular
                        position. With your right hand press the subject’s fingers over the back of
                        your thumb and tell him to grasp it firmly, to close his eyes and intently
                        concentrate his mind on the following suggestions: “I am so sleepy—so tired
                        and sleepy—I cannot think of anything but sleep.” After you tell the subject
                        to think of these suggestions, place the three fingers of your right hand,
                        spread apart, on the top of the subject’s head, a little toward the front,
                        with the thumb of the right hand resting on the bridge of the nose, or
                        between the eyebrows. You should exert an inward and downward pressure,
                        being careful not to hurt the subject. Then suggest to the subject in a
                        slow, positive, monotonous tone, “You are becoming drowsy—everything is
                        getting dark to you—you are so tired and sleepy—you cannot hear any sound
                        but my voice—when I count ten you will be sound asleep.
                        One-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight-nine-ten.” You should count slowly
                        and distinctly. As you finish counting ten, continue to suggest, “You are so
                        sleepy—you are breathing deeper—you are breathing heavier—you cannot hear
                        any sound but my voice—if anyone should call you, you will not answer. You
                        cannot hear anything but my voice.” These suggestions should be repeated
                        until the subject is fast asleep. If you do not get the subject to sleep the
                        first time you try him, arrange a sitting for another day. He should be
                        treated daily, giving him at least a half hour’s trial at each sitting.</p>

                                style="font-weight:bold">METHOD NO. 2.</em></span></h2>
                    <p>Have the subject seated in a common kitchen chair, so that the shoulders are
                        above the back of the chair. Tell the subject to sit with his feet flat on
                        the floor, to rest, hands on knees, to relax all of his muscles, to close
                        his eyes and intently think of sleep. Stand on the subject’s right side,
                        place the thumb of the right hand on the subject’s right temple, and the
                        first three fingers of the right hand on the subject’s left temple; the
                        pressure should be light. With the left hand grasp the subject at the back
                        of the neck, the idea being to prevent the circulation of blood in the head
                        as much as possible. Do not grasp the neck so as to hurt the subject, though
                        the pressure should be firm. Take as much of the neck in your hand as
                        possible, then tell the subject to relax his muscles, especially those of
                        the neck. Then roll the subject’s head to the right, making as large a
                        circle as possible; the movement should be slow. All the time you are doing
                        this, suggest to</p>
                    <p><em style="font-weight:bold">METHOD NO. 2.</em></p>
                    <p>the subject the same sleep formulas give in Method No. 1. After you have
                        rolled the head for five or ten minutes, gradually make the circle less
                        until it stops altogether. Keep the left hand in the original position, but
                        drop the right hand to the subject’s breast and as he exhales his breath,
                        press inward; as he inhales relax the pressure, and at the same time
                        suggest, “You are breathing deeper—you are breathing heavier—you are
                        breathing deeper—you are breathing heavier.” These suggestions should be
                        repeated for two or three minutes, then the subject is prepared to receive
                        the suggestions you wish to give him. The head should be rolled in the
                        direction the hands of a clock move, if placed face upward on the top of the
                        subject’s head. I have found this method superior to any other which I have
                        tried, altogether others will often produce the effect when this one will
                        not, and vice versa.</p>

                        relax all of his muscles. Tell him to try to give up the suggestions which
                        you are about to make. Have the arms lying straight down from the sides. You
                        should place the three fingers of both hands in the center of the forehead,
                        making a pass with both hands at the same time from the forehead down over
                        the temples to and off the cheek bones to the shoulders, then on down over
                        the arms, and off the tips of the subject's fingers. The pressure should be
                        very light. This pass should be made slowly, and at the same time, you
                        should suggest, "You are becoming drowsy—everything is getting dark to
                        you—you are so tired and sleepy—you cannot hear sound but my voice—when I
                        count ten you will be sound asleep.
                        One-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight-nine-ten."</p>
                    <p>The passes should be made for fifteen or twenty minutes. The subject is then
                        ready to receive the suggestions you wish to give him. At the end of each
                        pass, your hands should close, coming back in a circle, and the fingers
                        should not open until ready to be placed upon the forehead the next time.
                        This is an excellent method to use upon sick persons or those who are lying
                        down. In many cases the student will place the subject under hypnosis at the
                        first sitting, but sometimes it is necessary to continue these sittings for
                        a long time. It depends entirely upon the subject; if he is amenable to your
                        suggestions the effects are quickly produced. After you succeed in getting
                        the subject hypnotized once, it is much easier to do so the second time, and
                        you can make the subject act out any scene as described by another author
                        under the head of "How To Give Hypnotic Entertainments." After you put on a
                        few mental scenes, (or scenes where the subject is unconscious), it is not
                        necessary to re-hypnotize the subject to put on the next scene. Simply tell
                        him to close his eyes, place the fingers of your left hand on top of his
                        head with the thumb resting on the bridge of the subject's nose, between the
                        eyebrows, and say to him, "Now, when you open your eyes you will see
                        so-and-so." For instance, if you were going to make the subject believe he
                        is fishing, you would say to him, "Now, when you open your eyes you will see
                        a beautiful stream of water. You are sitting upon the bank of this stream
                        and you want to fish. I will give you a fishing-rod, you can bait your hook
                        and have a splendid time." Then say to the subject, "Open your eyes." Just
                        the moment his eyes open, your right hand should be ready to direct his gaze
                        to the stream of water and at the same time say, "Do you see that stream of
                        water?" making a gesture toward the stream with your right hand. If he says
                        no, make the gesture over and over again, until he sees it. It does not, as
                        a rule, take more than four or five of these passes to make the subject see
                        the water, then you can give him the other suggestions, relative to the
                        fishing-rod, etc</p>
